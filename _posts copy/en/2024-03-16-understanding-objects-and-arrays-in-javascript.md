### Introduction
In Javascript, objects and arrays are two fundamental data structures that are widely used in programming. Objects are used to store key-value pairs, while arrays are used to store lists of elements. Understanding how to work with objects and arrays is crucial for any Javascript developer.

### Objects
In Javascript, objects are created using curly braces `{}`. Each key-value pair inside the object is separated by a colon `:`. For example, `{name: "John", age: 30}` is an object with two key-value pairs. You can access the values of an object using dot notation or square bracket notation. For example, to access the `name` property of an object `person`, you can do `person.name` or `person["name"]`.

### Arrays
Arrays in Javascript are created using square brackets `[]`. Arrays can store a list of elements of any data type. You can access elements in an array using their index, with the first element at index 0. Arrays also have many built-in methods such as `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift` for adding and removing elements.

### Example Codes
1. Creating an object:
```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  city: "New York"
};
```

2. Accessing object properties:
```javascript
console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
console.log(person["age"]); // Output: 25
```

3. Creating an array:
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### Applicable Versions
The concepts of objects and arrays are fundamental to all versions of Javascript. However, newer versions of Javascript (ES6 and above) have introduced features such as object destructuring and the spread operator, which make working with objects and arrays even more powerful and convenient.

### Conclusion
Understanding how to work with objects and arrays in Javascript is essential for building robust and efficient applications. By mastering these fundamental data structures, you will be able to manipulate data effectively and write cleaner and more maintainable code. Experiment with creating objects and arrays, accessing their properties, and using built-in methods to strengthen your Javascript skills.
