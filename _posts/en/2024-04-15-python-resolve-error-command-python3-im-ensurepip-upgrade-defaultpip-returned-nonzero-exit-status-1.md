### Introduction: 
When working with Python, you may encounter errors that can be quite frustrating to understand and resolve. One common error that developers come across is the "Command returned non-zero exit status 1" error, especially when trying to upgrade pip using the 'ensurepip' module. 

### Understanding the Error:
The error message "Command ‘[‘python3’, ‘-Im’, ‘ensurepip’, ‘–upgrade’, ‘–default-pip’]’ returned non-zero exit status 1" indicates that the command being run has failed, and the status code returned was not 0, which signifies successful execution. In this case, the command is attempting to upgrade pip using the 'ensurepip' module.

### Possible Causes:
There could be various reasons why this error occurs, such as incorrect syntax in the command being executed, permission issues, or conflicts with the Python environment.

### Solutions:
1. **Check Syntax**: The first step is to ensure that the command syntax is correct. Double-check the command being executed to make sure there are no typos or syntax errors.
2. **Update Python**: Ensure that you are running the latest version of Python and that your system is up to date.
3. **Check Permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the command. If you are facing permission issues, try running the command with admin/root privileges.

### Example Codes and Output:
Here are 3 example codes that trigger the error and the corresponding output:
1. 
```python
import subprocess

command = ['python3', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']
result = subprocess.run(command)

print(result.returncode)
```
Output:
```
1
```

2. 
```python
import subprocess

command = ['python3', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']
result = subprocess.run(command)

print(result.returncode)
```
Output:
```
1
```

3. 
```python
import subprocess

command = ['python3', '-m', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']
result = subprocess.run(command)

print(result.returncode)
```
Output:
```
1
```

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the "Command returned non-zero exit status 1" error in Python typically occurs when there is an issue with the command being executed, such as incorrect syntax or permission problems. By understanding the possible causes and solutions, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve this error to continue with your Python development tasks.
