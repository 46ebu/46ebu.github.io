### What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. Python is interpreted, which means that the code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter.

### Syntax
Python uses indentation to define code blocks, unlike other languages that use curly braces or keywords. This makes Python code more readable and forces developers to write clean and organized code. For example, in Python, a for loop is defined by the keyword "for" followed by a colon and then an indented block of code.

### Example Codes
1. Hello World:
```python
print("Hello World")
```
This simple code snippet prints "Hello World" to the console. The `print()` function is used to display the text within the parentheses.

2. Sum of two numbers:
```python
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum is:", sum)
```
In this code, we declare two variables `num1` and `num2` with values 5 and 10 respectively. We then add them together and print the result.

3. Finding the maximum number in a list:
```python
numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5]
max_num = max(numbers)
print("The maximum number in the list is:", max_num)
```
Here, we have a list of numbers and we use the `max()` function to find the largest number in the list. The result is then printed to the console.

### Applicable Versions
Python has two major versions currently in use: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 will no longer be supported after January 1, 2020, so it is recommended to use Python 3 for new projects. Python 3 has many improvements and new features compared to Python 2.

In conclusion, Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is suitable for beginners and experienced developers alike. Its simple syntax and vast library of modules make it a popular choice for a wide range of applications. By mastering the basics of Python, you can unlock the full potential of this language and use it to create amazing projects.
