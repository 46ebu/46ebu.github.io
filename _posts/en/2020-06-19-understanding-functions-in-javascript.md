### Introduction to Functions in JavaScript

Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the `function` keyword followed by a function name, a list of parameters (optional), and the function body enclosed in curly braces. Functions are essential for organizing and structuring code, as well as for promoting reusability and maintainability.

### Syntax of Functions

The basic syntax of a function in JavaScript is as follows:

```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
    // function body
    return value; // optional return statement
}
```

Functions can be invoked (or called) using the function name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments inside the parentheses. When a function is called, the code inside the function body is executed.

### Example Codes

1. Simple function without parameters:

```javascript
function greet() {
    return "Hello, World!";
}

console.log(greet()); // Output: Hello, World!
```

2. Function with parameters:

```javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

3. Function with a return statement:

```javascript
function multiply(num1, num2) {
    return num1 * num2;
}

let result = multiply(4, 5);
console.log(result); // Output: 20
```

### Versions and Compatibility

Functions have been a fundamental feature of JavaScript since its inception. They are supported in all modern web browsers and Node.js environments. With the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), arrow functions were introduced as a concise way to write functions, providing an alternative syntax to traditional function expressions.

In conclusion, functions in JavaScript are versatile and powerful tools that play a crucial role in structuring code and enabling code reusability. Understanding how to define, call, and utilize functions is essential for any JavaScript developer.
