### Introduction to 'sed'
`sed` stands for stream editor, and it is a powerful command-line tool in Linux used for text manipulation. It is especially useful for parsing and transforming text in files. `sed` works by taking input from a file or standard input stream, processing it line by line, and then printing the result to standard output. It uses a scripting language for specifying editing commands, making it a versatile tool for various text editing tasks.

### Basic Syntax of 'sed'
The basic syntax of `sed` is as follows:
```
sed [OPTIONS] 'command' filename
```
In this syntax, `OPTIONS` are used to specify different options to modify the behavior of `sed`, while the `command` is a set of editing instructions enclosed in single quotes that `sed` will execute on the input file. The `filename` parameter specifies the file to operate on. If no filename is specified, `sed` reads input from the standard input stream.

### Example Codes
#### Example 1: Replace a word in a file
To replace all occurrences of a word in a file, you can use the following `sed` command:
```
sed 's/old_word/new_word/g' filename
```
In this command, `s` is the substitution command, and `g` stands for global (replaces all occurrences). This command will replace all instances of `old_word` with `new_word` in the file specified.

#### Example 2: Delete lines matching a pattern
To delete lines in a file that match a specific pattern, you can use the following `sed` command:
```
sed '/pattern/d' filename
```
In this command, `/pattern/` is the pattern to match, and `d` is the delete command. This command will remove all lines containing the specified pattern from the file.

#### Example 3: Print specific lines in a file
To print specific lines in a file, you can use the following `sed` command:
```
sed -n '5,10p' filename
```
In this command, `-n` suppresses automatic printing of lines, and `5,10p` prints lines 5 to 10 from the file specified. This command is useful for extracting specific lines from a file.

### Versions and Compatibility
`sed` is a standard Unix utility that is available on most Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It is a part of the GNU Core Utilities package and is widely supported across different Linux distributions. The commands and syntax provided in this post should work on modern versions of `sed`, ensuring compatibility and consistency across platforms.

In conclusion, `sed` is a versatile and powerful tool for text manipulation in Linux. By understanding its syntax and commands, you can perform a wide range of text editing tasks efficiently and effectively. Whether it's replacing text, deleting lines, or extracting specific content, `sed` offers a flexible and intuitive way to manipulate text files with ease.
