### What is ECMAScript 6 (ES6)?

ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth major release of the ECMAScript standard. It was finalized in June 2015 and brought significant enhancements to the JavaScript programming language. ES6 introduced a variety of new features and syntax improvements that make JavaScript code more concise, readable, and efficient.

### Key Features of ECMAScript 6

1. **Let & Const Declarations**:
ES6 introduced two new variable declaration keywords, `let` and `const`, in addition to the existing `var`. The `let` keyword allows you to declare block-scoped variables, while `const` is used to declare constants that cannot be reassigned.

```javascript
function demo() {
  var x = 10;
  let y = 20;
  const z = 30;
  
  // y and z are block-scoped
}
```

2. **Arrow Functions**:
Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They also have implicit return values and lexical scoping of `this`.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.map(num => num * 2);
```

3. **Template Literals**:
Template literals allow for easier string interpolation in JavaScript by using backticks (`) instead of quotes. They also support multi-line strings and expression interpolation.

```javascript
let name = 'Alice';
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;

console.log(greeting);
```

### Browser Support and Compatibility

While ES6 brought many improvements to JavaScript, not all browsers fully support its features. To ensure compatibility, developers often use transpilers like Babel to convert ES6 code into older ECMAScript versions that are widely supported by all browsers.

In conclusion, ECMAScript 6 introduced several powerful features that enhance the readability and maintainability of JavaScript code. By leveraging these features, developers can write more efficient and modern JavaScript applications.
