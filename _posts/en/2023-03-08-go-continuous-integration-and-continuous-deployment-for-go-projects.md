### Introduction
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) have become essential practices in modern software development. In the context of Go projects, CI/CD pipelines can help automate tasks such as testing, building, and deploying your applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to set up CI/CD for Go projects using popular tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

### Setting up CI with GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating workflows on GitHub repositories. To set up a CI pipeline for your Go project, you can create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file in your repository. Here's an example workflow that runs tests on your Go code:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: 1.17
      - name: Run tests
        run: go test ./...
```

In this workflow, we specify that the CI job should run on every push to the `main` branch. The job sets up the Go environment using the `actions/setup-go` action and then runs tests using the `go test` command.

### Setting up CD with Jenkins
Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that can be used to set up CI/CD pipelines for your Go projects. To set up a CD pipeline for your Go project, you can create a Jenkins pipeline script. Here's an example pipeline that builds and deploys a Go application:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'go build -o app'
      }
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        sh 'scp app user@server:/path/to/deployment'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this pipeline, we define two stages: `Build` and `Deploy`. The `Build` stage builds the Go application using the `go build` command, and the `Deploy` stage deploys the built application to a server using the `scp` command.

### Conclusion
Setting up CI/CD pipelines for your Go projects can help improve the quality and efficiency of your development process. By automating tasks such as testing and deployment, you can ensure that your applications are always up-to-date and functioning correctly. Whether you choose to use GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or another CI/CD tool, the key is to streamline your development workflow and make it as efficient as possible.
