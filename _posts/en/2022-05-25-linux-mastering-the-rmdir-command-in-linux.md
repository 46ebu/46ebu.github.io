### Introduction to 'rmdir' Command
The 'rmdir' command in Linux is used to remove empty directories. It is a simple yet powerful command that allows users to delete directories that do not contain any files or subdirectories. When compared to the 'rm' command which is used to remove files, 'rmdir' is specifically designed for deleting directories. 

### Syntax
The basic syntax of the 'rmdir' command is:
```
rmdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
```
Here, OPTION refers to any additional options that can be used with the command, and DIRECTORY is the name of the directory that you want to delete. 

### Examples
1. To remove a single empty directory:
``` 
rmdir directory_name
```
This command will delete the specified empty directory. If the directory is not empty, an error message will be displayed.

2. To remove multiple empty directories:
```
rmdir directory1 directory2 directory3
```
You can specify multiple directory names separated by spaces to delete multiple empty directories at once.

3. Using the -p option:
```
rmdir -p parent_directory/empty_directory
```
The -p option allows you to delete a directory along with its parent directories if they are also empty. This can be useful when you want to delete a series of nested empty directories in one go.

### Applicable Versions
The 'rmdir' command is available in most Linux distributions and Unix-like operating systems. It is a standard command that is included in the GNU coreutils package, which is essential for various system operations.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the 'rmdir' command is a handy tool for managing directories in Linux. By mastering this command, you can efficiently clean up your file system by removing empty directories without the need for manual deletions. Remember to exercise caution while using the 'rmdir' command, as it permanently deletes directories and their contents without the possibility of recovery. Happy deleting!
